A repository of my work -- including solutions to exercises and various C
programs -- of the second edition of Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie's book,
The C Programming Language.

All of the programs in this repo are more or less rough work (but also more or
less complete i.e. they compile and run). For some of these programs, there will
be a comment showing the compile command, with others that require linking
multiple files (like the RPN calculator in sections 4.5-4.6) there will be a
file that contains the compile command. If there is no indication of a compile
command, just use `gcc program_name.c && ./a.out` to compile and run. 

Many people suggest programmers to learn the C programming language so that they
can become more knowledgable and skilled programmers. As of writing this readme,
I am currently on the pointers chapter (chapter 5). Indeed, I do feel that I now
have a better appreciation for programming and computer systems. Moreover, this
book is absolutely amazing. The pedagogical approach that this book takes is so
far beyond most other technical books I have ever read and I will now
(unfortunately) be comparing every piece of 'tutorial' documentation to this
masterpiece.
